# hypernymy
With the work behind this repository, we aim at defining adjectival hypernymy through theoretical guidelines and a curated gold-standard benchmark of hyponym-hypernym pairs.

The dataset has been created by prompting three Large Language Models (gemma-3:27b, gpt-oss:20b, mistral-small:24b) to generate candidate hypernyms given input hyponyms. The outputs have been humanly validated and selected with specifically defined statistical thresholds. 

The results have been divided into three categories, based on the number of models that generated them:

- consensus (generated by all three models)
- majority (generated by two models)
- singleton (generated by only one model)

Th final dataset is available in both csv and rdf format, with linking to Open English WordNet synsets.
